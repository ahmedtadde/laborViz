The native HTML table presentation of the data makes it difficult to *visualize and derive trends*.\n\nTake a look at this:\n\n![image-cps-02][]\n\nas opposed to this:\n\n![image-trend-unemployed-rate][]\n\nWe will delve into details on some interesting topics revolved around:\n\n-   Labor Force Trends ([cps-02][])\n-   Employment by Occupation ([cps-14][])\n-   Employment by Education ([cps-07][])\n\nThe writeup will go into detailed analysis on some of the more interesting findings in the visualization sections.\n\nAt any time, feel free to experiment and draw your own conclusions with the interactive web application and refer to\nthe `.R` files found on the [Github][] project site if you need details on code implementation.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Labor Force Trends\n\n### What does the US population look like?\n\n![image-trend-population][]\n\nIt appears that the US population is still *growing*.  In addition, note that the population of women is *higher* than\nmen.\n\n### So who is NOT working in the labor force?\n\n![image-trend-non-labor-force][]\n\nWe see that a proportionately larger number of women are still not in the labor force, despite a slightly larger \nwomen population.\n\nThe next bar chart provides another view on the labor force by gender, by looking at employment *rates* instead of \nraw population headcount as displayed in the previous graph. \n\n![image-trend-employed-rate][]\n\nWe observe that there has been an increase in women being employed in the labor force over time (from 47.7% in 1980 \nto 53.2% in 2013).  This is a good sign and hopefully things continue to trend towards gender equality.\n\n### Should gender equality apply to all industries?\nLet's take a quick look at the *agriculture* industry sector, where we intuitively identify manual labor being \nemployed more readily in men than women.\n\n![image-trend-agricultural-labor-force][]\n\nWhoa! This makes intuitive sense, but there are some other interesting questions that can be gathered from this \nvisualization:\n\n1.   *Why is there a slight jump in women agriculture labor force from 1994-1999?*\n2.   *Why is there a sudden decrease in agriculture labor force recent years after 2000?*\n\nThese are questions that require research outside of the dataset, but I thought a few resources that I read online \nare potentially interesting explanations for some of the questions raised out of curiosity:\n\n1.  I have not found a possible answer for this, but I'll leave it for the audience to dig into why there is a slight \n    jump in women agriculture labor force involvement from 1994-1999.\n2.  This maybe due to the fact that farm decline stabilized around 1997, as detailed in this\n    [USDA article][usda farm decline], as total land for farms remained the same after a decline in overall farms\n    (i.e. farms stabilized into larger farms, which probably consolidated equipment and labor requirements over time)\n\n### How about the unemployed?\n\n![image-trend-unemployed-rate][]\n\nFrom this bar chart, we see that both men and women suffer through economic recessions.\n\nFor some interesting facts, here are some details on major [recessions] that occurred in the US.  I'm not an expert \nin labor statistics, but it seems that unemployment rates straggle a few more years after the recession periods \nbefore recovery.  And we seem to be experiencing some kind of recession every 10 years, although this is more of \nan observation and not a conclusive statement with the small dataset we are working with\n\n-   [Early 1980s Recession][] (1981 - 1982)\n-   [Early 1990s Recession][] (1990 - 1991)\n-   [The Great Recession][] (2007 - 2009)\n\nThis wraps up some of the visualizations that I found interesting.  Feel free to play with the webapp to discover \nmore findings!  In the next section, we will study in more detail how each race and gender group perform in various \noccupations and industries at certain age groups.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Employment by Occupation\n\n### A quick overview\nThe next facet plot visualization helps us get a quick overview on relative percentages of employed people across \ngenders and races in various occupations and industries, sliced by age groups.\n\n![image-occupation-all][]\n\nSome quick observations and comments:\n\n-   We will use percentages to convey the data instead of raw head counts, which will skew the visualization towards\n    the **White** demographic.\n-   All percentages within a race (column) sums up to 100% in a given age group, this helps us determine the \n    relative gender and racial distribution for each age group across occupations and industries.\n-   We observe that for age group 1 (16-19 years), most younger people in the labor force are engaged in \n    **Wholesale/Retail** as well as **Leisure Services** occupations, and for age group 4 (55 years and older), most\n    older people are engaging in **Education/Health Services**.  This seems to make intuitive sense: younger people \n    engage in industries that require higher energy and attention while older people fit better in less energetic \n    industries.\n-   Men-dominated industries include **Transportation/Utilities**, **Mining/Extraction**, **Manufacturing**, and \n    **Construction**, while women-dominated industries include **Education/Health Services**.  The rest of the \n    industry seem to have relatively equal gender distributions across all races.\n\n### Men-Dominated Industries\n\nKnowing that men are better suited at labor-intensive roles, we can take a closer look at the primary industry \nsector comprised of **Transportation/Utilities**, **Mining/Extraction**, **Manufacturing**, and **Construction**.\n\n![image-occupation-male-dominated][]\n\nA few interesting things stand out:\n\n-   Most of the primary industry sector labor force is in the age group 2 and 3 (20-24 years and 25-54 years).\n-   We see a general trend of lower **Mining/Extraction** and **Construction** jobs in favor of \n    **Transportation/Utilities** and **Manufacturing** jobs for the higher age groups, which makes intuitive sense \n    as manual labor-intensive jobs are better suited for the younger population.\n-   There is another observation that Hispanic males are disproportionately involved in the **Construction** \n    industry sector (as circled in red above, e.g. 19.9% Hispanics vs 13.6% White for age group 3)\n\nBy highlighting a specific age group (e.g. 20-24 years), and focusing on the blue columns which represent men labor \nforce, we can see some variations among the races in the occupations they engage in.\n\n![image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2]\n\nFor age group 2 (20-24 years):\n\n-   Asians are engaged more in **Manufacturing**.\n-   Blacks are engaged more in **Transportation/Utilities**.\n-   Hispanics are engaged more in **Construction**\n-   Whites are engaged slightly more evenly in **Manufacturing** and **Construction**.\n\nIn the next sections, we will take a close look at some specific industries across the dimensions of race, gender \nand age groups.\n\n### Education and Health Sector\n\nFirst up, we have the **Education/Health** sector, where we can obviously identify it as a women-dominated sector.\n\n![image-occupation-education-health][]\n\nHere is a summary of the distribution across age groups in **Education/Health**:\n\n-   Asians have roughly equivalent distribution across age groups.\n-   All the other races seem to have growing distribution towards working in the **Education/Health** sector as the \n    labor force gets older.\n\n### Public Administration Sector\n\nThere is a clear increase of older labor force participating in the **Public Administration** industry sector, with \nroughly equal gender distributions.\n\n![image-occupation-public-administration][]\n\n### Business and Finance Sector\n\nA quick look at the visualization suggests that younger people (age groups 1 and 2) are more engaged in \n**Wholesale/Retail**, while the older people (age groups 3 and 4) are engaged in **Professional/Business Services** \nand **Finance Services**.\n\nGender distributions across these service sector look roughly equivalent.\n\n![image-occupation-sales-business-finance][]\n\nThis wraps up some detailed facet plot visualizations of multi-dimensional analysis of labor force statistics across\nindustry, occupations, gender, races and age groups.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Employment by Education\n\nWe all hear the saying that getting a Bachelor's degree is *necessary* to finding jobs.  We will take a deeper look \ninto the dataset provided by CPS.\n\n### By gender\n\nHere are some quick numbers of the labor force by education level attainment.\n\n![image-education-labor-force-by-gender][]\n\nMost people in the US seem to have attained Bachelor degrees, or attended college with some associate or no degree.\n\nWhen we zone in on the unemployment rates, we find an inverse correlation with educational level and unemployment \nrate.  People holding bachelor degrees or attended college earning an associate degree have much lower unemployment \nrates than individuals who have not attended college or earned any degree.\n\nJudging by the numbers, it is recommended that you should try to earn at least an associate degree in college, since\nthe unemployment rates of graduating high school and attending college earning no degree are roughly the same.\n\n![image-education-unemployment-by-gender][]\n\nThe next section filters the results by race instead of gender.\n\n### By race\n\n![image-education-labor-force-by-race][]\n\nThe unemployment rate trend is essentially the same as we observed in the gender overview i.e. a higher education \ndegree confers better chances of getting a job.\n\n![image-education-unemployment-by-race][]\n\nHowever something stands out.\n\nWe see that the Black and Hispanic populations have higher unemployment rates than the other races at each education\nlevel attainment.  This may or may not be due to racial discrimination, but if we made the assumption that education\nhas delivered equal opportunities to individuals developing skills for work, then this is an area of improvement we \ncan work on if racial discrimination exists.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Conclusion\n>   Despite the focus on expressing gender and racial equality statistics on labor force, I strongly believe that\n>   the topic of labor statistics should revolve around **ability equality** and not around gender and racial equality.\n\nAs seen in the example of agricultural jobs, women lack the natural ability to perform in this industry, and this \nshould not be interpreted as discrimination when we evaluate people's ability to do certain work.\n\nWe need to be careful about over-emphasizing the obsession in optimizing \"gender/racial-equal\" numbers, which in my \nopinion, is another form of discrimination by overly stressing the concepts of genders and races, when our ultimate \ngoal is to hopefully not create concepts of races and genders when we are engaging in professional evaluations of \npeople.\n\nOur solutions in education and government policies should be geared towards empowering individuals with *equal \nopportunities* to pursue what they want to achieve in their careers, and it is very important that pre-employment \neducation is provided for every individual fairly, so that the true test of employment can be judged on a merit \nbasis, instead on trying to optimize \"gender/racial-equal\" metrics.\n\nIn the future, it is my hope that all `gender` and `race` data in these visualizations contained can be collapsed, \nproviding us with a simple analysis on our labor force statistics (as shown in the bar chart below without grouping \nby gender and race), one that is evaluated from all human individuals, as opposed to one evaluated based on races \nand genders.\n\n![image-trend-all][]\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n\n------\n\n## Data Resources\n-   CPS data: [cps-02][], [cps-14][], [cps-07][]\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n\n<!-- external links -->\n[interactive project link]: https://ahmedtadde.shinyapps.io/laborviz/\n[Shiny]: http://shiny.rstudio.com/\n[github]: https://github.com/ahmedtadde/laborViz\n[CPS]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/\n[cps-02]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm\n[cps-14]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat14.htm\n[cps-07]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm\n[dplyr]: http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html\n[usda farm decline]: http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm\n[recessions]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States\n[Early 1980s Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession\n[Early 1990s Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession\n[The Great Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession\n\n<!-- images link -->\n[image-cps-02]: ./www/image-cps-02.png\n[image-cps-14]: ./www/image-cps-14.png\n[image-cps-07]: ./www/image-cps-07.png\n[image-long-wide-df]: ./www/image-long-wide-df.png\n\n\n[image-trend-all]: ./www/image-trend-all.png\n[image-trend-population]: ./www/image-trend-population.png\n[image-trend-non-labor-force]: ./www/image-trend-non-labor-force.png\n[image-trend-employed-rate]: ./www/image-trend-employed-rate.png\n[image-trend-unemployed-rate]: ./www/image-trend-unemployed-rate.png\n[image-trend-agricultural-labor-force]: ./www/image-trend-agricultural-labor-force.png\n\n\n[image-occupation-all]: ./www/image-occupation-all.png\n[image-occupation-male-dominated]: ./www/image-occupation-male-dominated.png\n[image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2]: ./www/image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2.png\n[image-occupation-education-health]: ./www/image-occupation-education-health.png\n[image-occupation-public-administration]:./www/image-occupation-public-administration.png\n[image-occupation-sales-business-finance]: ./www/image-occupation-sales-business-finance.png\n\n\n[image-education-labor-force-by-gender]: ./www/image-education-labor-force-by-gender.png\n[image-education-unemployment-by-gender]:./www/image-education-unemployment-by-gender.png\n[image-education-labor-force-by-race]:./www/image-education-labor-force-by-race.png\n[image-education-unemployment-by-race]: ./www/image-education-unemployment-by-race.png\n",
