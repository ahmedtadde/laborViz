The native HTML table presentation of the data makes it difficult to *visualize and derive trends*.\n\nTake a look at this:\n\n![image-cps-02][]\n\nas opposed to this:\n\n![image-trend-unemployed-rate][]\n\nWe will delve into details on some interesting topics revolved around:\n\n-   Labor Force Trends ([cps-02][])\n-   Employment by Occupation ([cps-14][])\n-   Employment by Education ([cps-07][])\n\nThe writeup will go into detailed analysis on some of the more interesting findings in the visualization sections.  \nAn in-depth overview on data gathering, cleaning, and transformation of the original datasets will be outlined in \nthe [Data](#data) section.\n\nAt any time, feel free to experiment and draw your own conclusions with the interactive web application and refer to\nthe `.R` files found on the [Github][] project site if you need details on code implementation.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Labor Force Trends\n\n### What does the US population look like?\n\n![image-trend-population][]\n\nIt appears that the US population is still *growing*.  In addition, note that the population of women is *higher* than\nmen.\n\n### So who is NOT working in the labor force?\n\n![image-trend-non-labor-force][]\n\nWe see that a proportionately larger number of women are still not in the labor force, despite a slightly larger \nwomen population.\n\nThe next bar chart provides another view on the labor force by gender, by looking at employment *rates* instead of \nraw population headcount as displayed in the previous graph. \n\n![image-trend-employed-rate][]\n\nWe observe that there has been an increase in women being employed in the labor force over time (from 47.7% in 1980 \nto 53.2% in 2013).  This is a good sign and hopefully things continue to trend towards gender equality.\n\n### Should gender equality apply to all industries?\nLet's take a quick look at the *agriculture* industry sector, where we intuitively identify manual labor being \nemployed more readily in men than women.\n\n![image-trend-agricultural-labor-force][]\n\nWhoa! This makes intuitive sense, but there are some other interesting questions that can be gathered from this \nvisualization:\n\n1.   *Why is there a slight jump in women agriculture labor force from 1994-1999?*\n2.   *Why is there a sudden decrease in agriculture labor force recent years after 2000?*\n\nThese are questions that require research outside of the dataset, but I thought a few resources that I read online \nare potentially interesting explanations for some of the questions raised out of curiosity:\n\n1.  I have not found a possible answer for this, but I'll leave it for the audience to dig into why there is a slight \n    jump in women agriculture labor force involvement from 1994-1999.\n2.  This maybe due to the fact that farm decline stabilized around 1997, as detailed in this\n    [USDA article][usda farm decline], as total land for farms remained the same after a decline in overall farms\n    (i.e. farms stabilized into larger farms, which probably consolidated equipment and labor requirements over time)\n\n### How about the unemployed?\n\n![image-trend-unemployed-rate][]\n\nFrom this bar chart, we see that both men and women suffer through economic recessions.\n\nFor some interesting facts, here are some details on major [recessions] that occurred in the US.  I'm not an expert \nin labor statistics, but it seems that unemployment rates straggle a few more years after the recession periods \nbefore recovery.  And we seem to be experiencing some kind of recession every 10 years, although this is more of \nan observation and not a conclusive statement with the small dataset we are working with\n\n-   [Early 1980s Recession][] (1981 - 1982)\n-   [Early 1990s Recession][] (1990 - 1991)\n-   [The Great Recession][] (2007 - 2009)\n\nThis wraps up some of the visualizations that I found interesting.  Feel free to play with the webapp to discover \nmore findings!  In the next section, we will study in more detail how each race and gender group perform in various \noccupations and industries at certain age groups.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Employment by Occupation\n\n### A quick overview\nThe next facet plot visualization helps us get a quick overview on relative percentages of employed people across \ngenders and races in various occupations and industries, sliced by age groups.\n\n![image-occupation-all][]\n\nSome quick observations and comments:\n\n-   We will use percentages to convey the data instead of raw head counts, which will skew the visualization towards\n    the **White** demographic.\n-   All percentages within a race (column) sums up to 100% in a given age group, this helps us determine the \n    relative gender and racial distribution for each age group across occupations and industries.\n-   We observe that for age group 1 (16-19 years), most younger people in the labor force are engaged in \n    **Wholesale/Retail** as well as **Leisure Services** occupations, and for age group 4 (55 years and older), most\n    older people are engaging in **Education/Health Services**.  This seems to make intuitive sense: younger people \n    engage in industries that require higher energy and attention while older people fit better in less energetic \n    industries.\n-   Men-dominated industries include **Transportation/Utilities**, **Mining/Extraction**, **Manufacturing**, and \n    **Construction**, while women-dominated industries include **Education/Health Services**.  The rest of the \n    industry seem to have relatively equal gender distributions across all races.\n\n### Men-Dominated Industries\n\nKnowing that men are better suited at labor-intensive roles, we can take a closer look at the primary industry \nsector comprised of **Transportation/Utilities**, **Mining/Extraction**, **Manufacturing**, and **Construction**.\n\n![image-occupation-male-dominated][]\n\nA few interesting things stand out:\n\n-   Most of the primary industry sector labor force is in the age group 2 and 3 (20-24 years and 25-54 years).\n-   We see a general trend of lower **Mining/Extraction** and **Construction** jobs in favor of \n    **Transportation/Utilities** and **Manufacturing** jobs for the higher age groups, which makes intuitive sense \n    as manual labor-intensive jobs are better suited for the younger population.\n-   There is another observation that Hispanic males are disproportionately involved in the **Construction** \n    industry sector (as circled in red above, e.g. 19.9% Hispanics vs 13.6% White for age group 3)\n\nBy highlighting a specific age group (e.g. 20-24 years), and focusing on the blue columns which represent men labor \nforce, we can see some variations among the races in the occupations they engage in.\n\n![image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2]\n\nFor age group 2 (20-24 years):\n\n-   Asians are engaged more in **Manufacturing**.\n-   Blacks are engaged more in **Transportation/Utilities**.\n-   Hispanics are engaged more in **Construction**\n-   Whites are engaged slightly more evenly in **Manufacturing** and **Construction**.\n\nIn the next sections, we will take a close look at some specific industries across the dimensions of race, gender \nand age groups.\n\n### Education and Health Sector\n\nFirst up, we have the **Education/Health** sector, where we can obviously identify it as a women-dominated sector.\n\n![image-occupation-education-health][]\n\nHere is a summary of the distribution across age groups in **Education/Health**:\n\n-   Asians have roughly equivalent distribution across age groups.\n-   All the other races seem to have growing distribution towards working in the **Education/Health** sector as the \n    labor force gets older.\n\n### Public Administration Sector\n\nThere is a clear increase of older labor force participating in the **Public Administration** industry sector, with \nroughly equal gender distributions.\n\n![image-occupation-public-administration][]\n\n### Business and Finance Sector\n\nA quick look at the visualization suggests that younger people (age groups 1 and 2) are more engaged in \n**Wholesale/Retail**, while the older people (age groups 3 and 4) are engaged in **Professional/Business Services** \nand **Finance Services**.\n\nGender distributions across these service sector look roughly equivalent.\n\n![image-occupation-sales-business-finance][]\n\nThis wraps up some detailed facet plot visualizations of multi-dimensional analysis of labor force statistics across\nindustry, occupations, gender, races and age groups.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Employment by Education\n\nWe all hear the saying that getting a Bachelor's degree is *necessary* to finding jobs.  We will take a deeper look \ninto the dataset provided by CPS.\n\n### By gender\n\nHere are some quick numbers of the labor force by education level attainment.\n\n![image-education-labor-force-by-gender][]\n\nMost people in the US seem to have attained Bachelor degrees, or attended college with some associate or no degree.\n\nWhen we zone in on the unemployment rates, we find an inverse correlation with educational level and unemployment \nrate.  People holding bachelor degrees or attended college earning an associate degree have much lower unemployment \nrates than individuals who have not attended college or earned any degree.\n\nJudging by the numbers, it is recommended that you should try to earn at least an associate degree in college, since\nthe unemployment rates of graduating high school and attending college earning no degree are roughly the same.\n\n![image-education-unemployment-by-gender][]\n\nThe next section filters the results by race instead of gender.\n\n### By race\n\n![image-education-labor-force-by-race][]\n\nThe unemployment rate trend is essentially the same as we observed in the gender overview i.e. a higher education \ndegree confers better chances of getting a job.\n\n![image-education-unemployment-by-race][]\n\nHowever something stands out.\n\nWe see that the Black and Hispanic populations have higher unemployment rates than the other races at each education\nlevel attainment.  This may or may not be due to racial discrimination, but if we made the assumption that education\nhas delivered equal opportunities to individuals developing skills for work, then this is an area of improvement we \ncan work on if racial discrimination exists.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Conclusion\n>   Despite the focus on expressing gender and racial equality statistics on labor force, I strongly believe that\n>   the topic of labor statistics should revolve around **ability equality** and not around gender and racial equality.\n\nAs seen in the example of agricultural jobs, women lack the natural ability to perform in this industry, and this \nshould not be interpreted as discrimination when we evaluate people's ability to do certain work.\n\nWe need to be careful about over-emphasizing the obsession in optimizing \"gender/racial-equal\" numbers, which in my \nopinion, is another form of discrimination by overly stressing the concepts of genders and races, when our ultimate \ngoal is to hopefully not create concepts of races and genders when we are engaging in professional evaluations of \npeople.\n\nOur solutions in education and government policies should be geared towards empowering individuals with *equal \nopportunities* to pursue what they want to achieve in their careers, and it is very important that pre-employment \neducation is provided for every individual fairly, so that the true test of employment can be judged on a merit \nbasis, instead on trying to optimize \"gender/racial-equal\" metrics.\n\nIn the future, it is my hope that all `gender` and `race` data in these visualizations contained can be collapsed, \nproviding us with a simple analysis on our labor force statistics (as shown in the bar chart below without grouping \nby gender and race), one that is evaluated from all human individuals, as opposed to one evaluated based on races \nand genders.\n\n![image-trend-all][]\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Data\n>   This section provides details on the data source and processes that go towards scraping and munging the initial \n>   unorganized data into a consolidated R dataframe that is used in the Shiny app.  We will make references to the \n>   files on the [Github][github] project.\n\nAll data is owned by the Current Population Survey ([CPS][]) made available by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  I am \nnot affiliated with CPS, and this writeup and application is purely for practicing and sharing thoughts behind data \nmanagement and visualization.\n\nIf you are not interested in the data background and processes, feel free to jump back to the visualization sections!\n\n### Data Source\nWe will be using the following CPS datasets:\n\n-   [cps-02][]: Time series of employment statistics by gender.\n    \n    ![image-cps-02][]\n\n-   [cps-14][]: Most recent employment statistics by industry, age, gender, and race.\n\n    ![image-cps-14][]\n\n-   [cps-07][]: Most recent employment statistics by education level, gender, and race.\n\n    ![image-cps-07][]\n\nCareful observation of the native data presentation suggests that the data tables involve some nesting.  For a \ngeneral workflow with R and Shiny visualizations, we would need to collapse the data into a *flat* dataframe structure.\n\n*Luckily*, it looks like the HTML tables themselves *follow some kind of pattern*.  The fact that some consistent \nstructure exists means that we can put our data munging skills to good use and transform the data into a better \nstructure for reusable code in future programs.\n\nBut first, let's scrape the data before cleaning it up!\n\n### Data Scraping\nFor the following section, we will walk through only one example of a data scraping/munging step abstracted in the \nfunction `get_labor_trend` in the `/data/parser.R` file.  We will refer the readers to dig into the other functions \nin detail at their own pace (most of them are similar in construction and abstraction).\n\nOpen the `/data/parser.R` file and locate the `get_labor_trend` function.\n\n>   In general, it is a good idea to build your data processing steps into multiple readable functions, so that they\n>   can be called in future applications and programs.\n\nWe will use the package `XML` for reading a HTML table into an R dataframe with the help of the function \n`readHTMLTable`.\n\nWe first define the `url` and `colnames` variables, where the `url` points to the CPS dataset URL, and `colnames` is \na convenient *named* vector to pass both the column names and column types to the dataframe we are creating with \n`readHTMLTable`.\n\n```R\nurl <- \"http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm\"\ncolnames <- c(\"year\" = \"integer\",\n              \"Total Population\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"Labor Force (Total)\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"% Labor Force (Total)\" = \"numeric\",\n              \"Labor Force (Employed)\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"% Labor Force (Employed)\" = \"numeric\",\n              \"Labor Force (Agriculture)\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"Labor Force (Non-agriculture)\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"Labor Force (Unemployed)\" = \"FormattedInteger\",\n              \"% Labor Force (Unemployed)\" = \"numeric\",\n              \"Non-Labor Force (Total)\" = \"FormattedInteger\")\n              \ntables <- readHTMLTable(url, stringsAsFactors=FALSE, colClasses=unname(colnames))\n```\n\n>   The use of a *named* vector for `colnames` allows us to easily extract two sets of information in one variable\n>   i.e. `names(colnames)` extracts the names while `unname(colnames)` extracts the format types of the named vector\n>   `colnames`.\n\nWe pass in `stringsAsFactors=FALSE` to prevent conversion of string variables into factors, which will be quite a \npain to deal with for future processes, so let's just keep to primitive data types used in common programming \nlanguages.\n\nBy using the R-console and a couple of `print` statements, we learn that the variable `tables` is a list of HTML \ntables that are found on the URL.\n\n>   If you are interested, you can view the source page of the URL and check that there are indeed the same number \n>   of tables as the dimensions of our `tables`.\n\nAssuming that CPS keeps the format of their dataset/webpage in the same format, we can locate the data we want as \nthe second table in the URL.\n\nLet's assign this to the variable `df`.\n\n```R\ndf <- tables[[2]]\n```\n\nTry printing the value of`df`.\n\nIt looks a little unstructured, despite living in a dataframe.  Our goal now is to reshape the dataframe into a flat\nand long format, and this is best accomplished using the great `dplyr` library produced by Hadley Wickham, which \nbeautifully abstracts common reshaping workflows in R into a concise and readable syntax and implementation\n\n>   The rest of the data section assumes elementary knowledge of `dplyr`.  We assume familiarity with methods such \n>   as: `%>%`, `mutate`, `select`, `arrange`, `rename`.  Please check out the official `dplyr` [official guide][dplyr] \n>   if you need additional resources.\n\n### Data Munging\nWith `dplyr` and `reshape2`, it's time to hack and slash!\n\nLet's do some very basic cleaning steps to rename the columns and remove `NA` records (caused by nesting in the \noriginal HTML table that produces whitespaces during the data import through `readHTMLTable`).\n\n```R\ncolnames(df) <- names(colnames)  # rename columns\ndf <- df %>% na.omit()  # remove NAs\n```\n\nThe next step is to spend some time carefully observe the [cps-02] dataset and its structure and patterns:\n\n![image-cps-02][]\n\nAnd see if we can wrangle it to, perhaps, this preferred nice, flat and long structure:\n\n![image-long-wide-df][]\n\nNotice that the original data structure has column headers which can be pivoted into values under a new variable \n`population`.  This will allow us to pivot and reshape the wide dataframe into a long dataframe if we pivot on the \nvariables `year` and `gender`.\n\nHowever, there is one pesky problem.\n\nThe gender in the original data structure is located in a `subtotal` row.  We need to find a way to populate the \n`\"Men\"` and `\"Women\"` gender values in all the data records, while potentially acknowledging that the dataset \nrecords can vary (inclusion or exclusion of years for each gender).\n\nOur human skills of observation and pattern recognition intuitively suggests to us that this dataset contains twice \nthe amount of record for each gender.  By observation, we also note note that the initial data is sorted by `\"Men\"`,\nthen by `\"Women\"`.\n\nThis suggests that we can generate a dynamic `genders` vector with number of records dependent on the size of the \ndataframe itself i.e. `genders=c(\"Men\", \"Men\", ..., \"Women\", \"Women\")`.  R does this nicely for us through the use:\n\n```R\ngenders <- rep(c(\"Men\", \"Women\"), each=nrow(df)/2)  # create genders column to correct length\n```\n\nPrint the variable `genders` to see for yourself, we indeed have a vector `genders=c(\"Men\", \"Men\", ..., \"Women\", \n\"Women\")` that we can integrate into our dataframe `df` using `dplyr`'s `mutate` method.\n\n```R\ndf <- df %>% mutate(gender = genders)  # add gender column\n```\n\nThe last step for the data munging process is to pivot the dataframe from wide to long format on the variables \n`gender` and `year`.  This collapses all the column headers into data values under a new column variable, which we \nwill call `population`.\n\nReassign the \"melted\" dataframe to itself again, and convert the `population` column into a `character` column \n(BOOOO to factors unless we absolutely need it!), and finally do some cosmetic sorting with the `arrange` method.\n\n```R\ndf <- melt(df, id=c(\"year\", \"gender\")) %>%  # melt from wide to long\n        rename(population = variable) %>%\n        mutate(population = as.character(population)) %>%\n        arrange(gender, population)\n```\n\nTry printing `df` again:\n\n![image-long-wide-df][]\n\nWoohoo! This looks clean and long, just what we need for data post-processing and visualizations!\n\nPlease feel free to go over the other functions and data manipulation steps.  The general idea is common across all \nof them, and they are summarized below.\n\n### Data Recap\n-   Abstract data gathering and processes into functions.\n-   Define variables, and utilize the strengths of named vectors through the R functions `names` and `unname`.\n-   Load the HTML tables into dataframes initially with     `readHTMLTable`.\n-   Build vectors using `rep(vector, each)` by careful observation of the original data structure and desired final \n    data structure.\n-   Include all missing columns into the dataframe before the final pivot step to collapse the dataframe from wide \n    to long, with the help of `reshape2`'s `melt` function.\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n## Resources\n-   CPS data: [cps-02][], [cps-14][], [cps-07][]\n-   [Shiny][]\n-   [dplyr][]\n-   [Shiny EC2 Bootstrap Guide][]\n\n<sub>(back to [contents](#contents))</sub>\n\n------\n\n\n<!-- external links -->\n[interactive project link]: http://shiny.vis.datanaut.io/LaborForceStatistics/\n[Shiny]: http://shiny.rstudio.com/\n[github]: https://github.com/chrisrzhou/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics\n[CPS]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/\n[cps-02]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat02.htm\n[cps-14]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat14.htm\n[cps-07]: http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.htm\n[dplyr]: http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html\n[Shiny EC2 Bootstrap Guide]: https://github.com/chrisrzhou/RShiny-EC2Bootstrap\n[usda farm decline]: http://www.usda.gov/factbook/chapter3.htm\n[recessions]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States\n[Early 1980s Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession\n[Early 1990s Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession\n[The Great Recession]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession\n\n<!-- images link -->\n[image-cps-02]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-02.png\n[image-cps-14]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-14.png\n[image-cps-07]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/cps-07.png\n[image-long-wide-df]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/long-wide-df.png\n[image-trend-all]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-all.png\n[image-trend-population]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-population.png\n[image-trend-non-labor-force]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-non-labor-force.png\n[image-trend-employed-rate]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-employed-rate.png\n[image-trend-unemployed-rate]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-unemployed-rate.png\n[image-trend-agricultural-labor-force]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/trend-agricultural-labor-force.png\n[image-occupation-all]:https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-all.png\n[image-occupation-male-dominated]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-male-dominated.png\n[image-occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-male-dominated-age-group-2.png\n[image-occupation-education-health]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-education-health.png\n[image-occupation-public-administration]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-public-administration.png\n[image-occupation-sales-business-finance]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/occupation-sales-business-finance.png\n[image-education-labor-force-by-gender]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-labor-force-by-gender.png\n[image-education-unemployment-by-gender]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-unemployment-by-gender.png\n[image-education-labor-force-by-race]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-labor-force-by-race.png\n[image-education-unemployment-by-race]: https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/chrisrzhou/github/RShiny-LaborForceStatistics/education-unemployment-by-race.png\n",
